            <p>.map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements. map() maps an element of an array, performs an operation with it and returns the result in an array. </p>
            <p>Let's see an example how map() warks. Let's say we have a list of numbers in an array and we want to square each of the array elements.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="font-bold">const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</p>
            <p class="font-bold">const squares = numbers.map( x => x*x)</p>
            <p class="my-2">The output of this function will be</p>
            <p class="font-bold">square = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]</p>


            <!-- for Each -->
            <p class="mb-5 mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">.forEach()</p>
            <p>.forEach() calls a function for every element in an array and it does not returns anything. .forEach() calls a function for each element, operates on those elements and displays the final elements. It returns only single element. </p>
            <p>Let's see an example how map() warks. Let's say we have a list of numbers in an array and we want to square each of the array elements.</p>

          <!-- filter -->
            <p class="mb-5 mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">.filter()</p>
            <p>The filter() method creates a new array with all those elements that fulfil the conditions that are given inside the filter(). It does not execute the function for empty elements. The original array remains the same. It does not change the original array/object.</p>
            <p>let's see an example how filter() works.  Let's say we have a list of numbers in an array and we want those values only who are greater than 10.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="font-bold">const numbers = [1, 5, 10, 15, 3, 7, 20, 32, 1]</p>
            <p class="font-bold">const newNumbers = numbers.filter( x => x > 10)</p>
            <p class="my-2">The output of this function will be</p>
            <p class="font-bold">newNumbers = [15, 20, 32]</p>


          <!-- find() -->
            <p class="mb-5 mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">.find()</p>
            <p>The find() method the first element that fulfil the conditions that are given inside the find(). It returns a single element. It does not execute the function for empty elements. The original array remains the same. It does not change the original array/object.</p>
            <p>let's see an example how find() works.  Let's say we have a list of numbers in an array and we want those values only who are greater than 10.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl"><span class="text-blue-600 font-bold">Question-1 : </span>What is Event loop? How it works?</h3>
            <p><span class="text-blue-600 font-bold text-2xl">Answer: </span></p>
            <p>The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and the call stack. It manages asynchronous operations in a program. It is the central component of many event-driven architectures and is commonly used in web browsers, server-side frameworks, and other applications that require non-blocking I/O.</p>
            <p class="my-2">The event loop works by continuously monitoring a queue of events or tasks, and executing them one by one as they are added to the queue. When an asynchronous operation, such as a network request or a file read, is initiated, the event loop adds a corresponding event or task to the queue and continues to process other events in the meantime. Once the asynchronous operation is complete, the event loop retrieves the corresponding event from the queue and executes any callbacks or handlers associated with that event.</p>
            <p>Various types of events, including timers, user input, and system events are also handled by the event loop. It ensures that events are processed in a timely and efficient manner, and that the program remains responsive even when multiple events are occurring simultaneously.</p>
            <p class="my-2">Overall, the event loop is a key component of many modern programming environments, that provides an efficient and scalable mechanism for managing asynchronous operations and enabling the development of highly responsive and efficient software.</p>
